# Bank of Faltiron

Using react's concepts on components, props, state, events and data fetching I built a react application that displays a list of recent bank transactions, adds new transactions, sorts them as per the description and deletes any transaction of your choice.

## Data

The data json data is from the url as follows [http://localhost:8001/transactions](http://localhost:8001/transactions)
Run the command [json-server --watch db.json](json-server --watch db.json) to watch the data from the db.json file.

### npm start

After creating all the required node packages run the npm start to runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3001/ to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### An overview of the app
Here is an image url of how the final display of the app should look "file:///home/mitchell/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot%20from%202023-11-03%2017-55-08.png"
